# pygame-catan
The goal of this project to create a atleast semi working version of settlers of catan, which I have achieved but do not have all the features implemented. This project is meant to played with multiple people and acts as a virtual game board. All features of catan are implemented except trading between players, ports, and development cards.

## challenges
This has been the first project I've taken on that has involved OOP, so that took some time getting used to but once I figured it out it was extremly helpful for keeping track of everything. Other challenges include something as simple as drawing the game board. I needed to find a way to draw the hexagons perfectly so they all intersected in the same places. Along with this I had to come up with solutions to clicking because it is hard to click on a non rectangular object.
